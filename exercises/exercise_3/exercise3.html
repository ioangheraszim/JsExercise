          <p class="question">1. How does the DOM differ from HTML?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that
            represents the structure of a document as objects. It provides a way
            to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of
            a web document using programming languages like JavaScript. However,
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used for
            creating the structure and content of web documents. While HTML
            defines the elements and their attributes, the DOM allows dynamic
            access and modification of these elements using code.

            2. What is event delegation, and why is it useful?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Event delegation refers how the process of using event propagation
            to handle events at a higher level in the dom than the element on
            which the event originated. It allows us to attach a single event
            listener for elements that exist now or in the future.
