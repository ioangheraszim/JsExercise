            1. Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            A closure in JavaScript occurs when a function is defined inside
            another function, and the inner function retains access to the outer
            function's variables and the global scope. This feature allows the
            enclosed function to "close over" the surrounding environment,
            maintaining access to the variables even after the outer function
            has completed execution. Closures are particularly useful for
            creating data privacy in JavaScript. By encapsulating variables
            within a closure, you can restrict their access, preventing
            unintended modifications from outside the closure. This capability
            is widely employed in various programming patterns, including the
            creation of private variables and the implementation of the module
            pattern. In summary, closures in JavaScript provide a mechanism for
            functions to retain access to the scope in which they were created,
            offering benefits such as data encapsulation, privacy, and the
            ability to create modular and maintainable code.

            2. What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Difference between <strong>let</strong> and
            <strong>const</strong> and <strong>var</strong> is in their scope
            rules and how it is possible for them to be reassigned. Let and var
            lets you create variables that can be reassigned. The difference
            however is in their scope, <strong>let</strong> is block scoped and
            <strong>var</strong> is function scoped. <strong>Const</strong> is
            used when we want a variables value to be constant. However arrays
            and objects value can still be changed.
